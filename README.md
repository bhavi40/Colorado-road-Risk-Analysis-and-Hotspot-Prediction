# Colorado Road Risk Analysis and Hotspot Prediction

This project aims to predict road accident severity and identify hotspots in Colorado using machine learning models. The model was trained on a dataset that includes traffic and weather conditions to predict crash severity levels.

## Project Structure
- **app.py**: The main Python file for running the web application.
- **MLmodels_code.zip**: Contains the trained machine learning models.
- **Dataset**: Contains a Google Drive link to access the dataset.
- **best_model_random_forest.pkl**: Trained Random Forest model for accident severity prediction.
- **hotspot_clusters.pkl**: Clusters of accident hotspots based on traffic and weather data.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the necessary Python packages to run the project.

## How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Install the necessary dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
python app.py
```

- Access the web application in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
